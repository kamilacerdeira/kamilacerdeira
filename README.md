## Hi There ğŸ‘‹
I am a 23 years old Brazilian woman from Belo Horizonte - MG. I am currently going through a career transition process, 
totally changing the area of activity (Humanities â†’ Web Development).

Technology has always been present in my life, even if not in professional ways! As much as I chose to study history in college, 
programming insisted on knocking on the door from time to time. Until, last year, when I decided to make 
this relationship official!

My journey through Humanities didn't come close to being a waste of time ... it led me to get where I am now, with all 
my strengths and potentials, which will help me to succeed in technology and maybe, who knows, in your project!

I'm currently working as a react developer at Farmly, seeking to collaborate with Front-end projects using React.
